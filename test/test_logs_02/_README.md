These datalogs are from the SABC flow. They are included to test datalogs that
don't have the header-every-time option checked.

The original purpose was to examine the frc_tco data to check if any unit had
issues with their temperature coefficient vs FRC frequency across temperature.

File names are of the form:
    u<unit#>_<environment>.txt

example:
    u3_25C.txt
